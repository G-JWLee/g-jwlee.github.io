## About Me

Thanks for visiting my website!ðŸ˜„     
I received a M.S. degree in Artificial Intelligence at KAIST, [MLAI Lab](https://www.mlai-kaist.com/) (Advisor: [Prof.Sung Ju Hwang](http://www.sungjuhwang.com/)) in Aug 2024, and a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering at KAIST in Feb 2023.     
I'm currently working as an AI researcher at [DeepAuto](https://www.deepauto.ai/).     

## Research Interests
My goal is to promote AI democratization by developing resource-efficient multimodal models that makes AI more accessible and interactive for anyone.
- **Multimodal (Vision-Language, Audiovisual, Interleaved modalities):**  
I aim to uncover interactions between modalities and, based on these insights, develop models that understand various multimodal knowledge, leading to more accessible and interactive AI.
- **Efficiency in data & algorithms (Data selection, Continual learning, Curriculum learning):**  
To further enhance AI accessibility, I aim to design algorithms that minimize the training costs of models. I am drawn to combining data curation with continual or curriculum learning ([Empirical Study](./assets/files/empirical_study.pdf)).
- **Efficiency in systems (Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Information retrieval):**  
Storing enormous and growing world knowledge in models is challenging. I aim to decouple knowledge from task-solving skills.
- **Efficiency in architectures (Mixture of Experts, Token pruning):**  
I am passionate about designing architectures for efficient training and deployment of models for complex tasks and multimodalities.
- **Interpretability (Interpretable LLM and MLL, Attribution methods):**   
Effective frameworks stem from understanding model behaviors and data. I am interested in exploring how modalities interact during processing.
