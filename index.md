## About Me

Thanks for visiting my website!ðŸ˜„     
I am an incoming Ph.D. student at UNC Chapel Hill, [MURGe-Lab](https://murgelab.cs.unc.edu/) (Advisor: [Prof. Mohit Bansal](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~mbansal/)). Previously, I collaborated with [Prof. Boyang Li](http://boyangli.org/) at NTU. I had an internship at the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/), where I had the opportunity to collaborate with [Prof. Paul Liang](https://pliang279.github.io/) and [Prof. Yi R. Fung](https://mayrfung.github.io/).
I received a M.S. degree in Artificial Intelligence at KAIST in Aug 2024 ([Prof. Sung Ju Hwang](http://www.sungjuhwang.com/)) and a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering at KAIST in Feb 2023.


## Research Interests
<!-- My goal is to promote AI democratization by developing resource-efficient multimodal models that make AI more accessible and interactive for anyone.
- **Multimodal (Vision-Language, Audio-Visual, Interleaved modalities):**  
I am intrigued by uncovering interactions between modalities and, based on these insights, developing models that understand various multimodal knowledge, leading to more accessible and interactive AI.
- **Efficiency in data & algorithms (Data selection, Continual learning, Curriculum learning):**  
To further enhance AI accessibility, I am keen on designing algorithms that minimize the training costs of models. I am currently interested in combining data curation with continual or curriculum learning ([Empirical Study](./assets/files/empirical_study.pdf)).
- **Efficiency in systems (Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Information retrieval):**  
Storing enormous and growing world knowledge in models is challenging. I aim to decouple knowledge from task-solving skills.
- **Efficiency in architectures (Mixture of Experts, Token reduction, Model Compression):**  
I am passionate about designing architectures for efficient training and deployment of models for complex tasks and multimodalities.
- **Interpretability (Interpretable LLM and MLLM, Attribution methods):**   
Effective frameworks stem from understanding model behaviors and data. I am interested in exploring how modalities interact during processing. -->
