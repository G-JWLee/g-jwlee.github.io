## About Me

Thanks for visiting my website!ðŸ˜„     
I received a M.S. degree in Artificial Intelligence at KAIST, [MLAI Lab](https://www.mlai-kaist.com/) (Advisor: [Prof.Sung Ju Hwang](http://www.sungjuhwang.com/)) in Aug 2024, and a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering at KAIST in Feb 2023.     
I'm currently working as an AI researcher at [DeepAuto](https://www.deepauto.ai/).     

## Research Interests
My goal is to promote greater AI accessibility in everyday life, with research focused on
- **Multimodal (Vision-Language, Audio-Video, Audio-Image, Interleaved modalities):** I aim to discover multimodal interactions within data and, based on these insights, develop models that effectively understand various modalities, leading to enhanced human-machine interaction and increased AI accessibility in human life.     
- **Efficiency (Data pruning, Token Selection, Model compression):** To further enhance the AI accessibility, I aim to minimize training or inference costs of models by developing algorithms that identify data or model structure redundancies.          
- **Continual Learning:** I am also interested in developing algorithms that keep models up-to-date by effectively integrating emerging knowledge.     
- **Curriculum Learning:** One of my interests is discovering the relationship between task-solving skills in Large Vision-Language Models to optimize instruction tuning data order, improving training efficiency ([Empirical Study](./assets/files/Skill_based_Curriculumn_Learning_for_Large_Vison_Language_Models.pdf)).
