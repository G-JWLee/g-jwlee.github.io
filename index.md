## About Me

Thanks for visiting my website!ðŸ˜„     
I received an M.S. degree in Artificial Intelligence from KAIST, [MLAI Lab](https://www.mlai-kaist.com/) (Advisor: [Prof.Sung Ju Hwang](http://www.sungjuhwang.com/)) in Aug 2024, and a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from KAIST in Feb 2023.     
I'm currently working as an AI researcher at [DeepAuto](https://www.deepauto.ai/).     

## Research Interests
My goal is to make AI more accessible in everyday life, with research focused on
- **Multimodal:** My goal is to develop multimodal models that enhance human-machine interaction and increase AI accessibility in everyday life.     
- **Efficiency:** To further enhance the AI accessibility, I aim to minimize AI training & inference costs by developing algorithms that identify data or model redundancies.          
- **Continual Learning:** I am also interested in maintaining models up-to-date by effectively integrating emerging knowledge.     
- **Instruction Tuning:** I want to discover structures of skills from Large Vision-Language Models and use them to optimize [training order](./assets/files/Skill_based_Curriculumn_Learning_for_Large_Vison_Language_Models.pdf) to enhance efficiency.
